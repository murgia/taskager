Welcome to Taskager!

This is the app that will make create simple to-do lists for various groups you may come across.  The idea behind this app is that a user could create groups, members for those groups, and tasks for those members.  The user would then be able to send out a link to people in those groups where they could view theirs and others tasks without editing or changing them.

The app was built from the ground up using Ruby on Rails.  The devise gem was used to create user authenticity.

The original idea involved creating an app where one person would control all of the different groups.  In the future I would substitute the member class for the user class so each user could create their own board of separate groups.  Users would then be able to join those controls so the functionality of the app would extend beyond would person.
