## Project Workflow
Meets expectations. Sounds like you hit all your user stories! Great planning. I would love to see set up instructions for your application as well as any ice box features you'd like to implement. Additionally would love to see more extensive wireframing and sketching.

## Technical Requirements
Meets/exceeds expectations. I really like the domain of your problem. I think you did a great job implementing all of the CRUD functionality for this application. You were very methodical about authorizations and creation of objects with foreign keys. I also like that nothing seems to be auto generated and a lot of care was put into each action for every controller you made.

## Code Quality
Meets Expectations. Code is properly indented. But there is a severe lack of comments! I'm the same way, I get caught up in code and forget to comment, but it can be so helpful moving forward as a develper.

## Deployment and Functionality
Site Looks great. Fully functional in the deployed version. Great job

## Overall
Was really pleased by your project! Seems like you have a strong understanding of all the fundamentals covered so far. I would encourage you to try using another external dependency for the next project!
